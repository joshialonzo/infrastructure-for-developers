# Django Architectures

This is the documentation of the Django architectures. In this section we will explore different architectures that can be built using the Python Boto3 library. We understand we can build different architectures. The first one is using a monolith. Then, we can split the mononolith into a REST Backend (with DRF) and a Single Page Application (SPA). The backend can run on a virtual machine or in a serverless architecture.

## Elements of Architecture

* EC2 Instance
* VPC Network
* S3 Bucket
* RDS Database
* ECS Orchestrator
* ECR Container Registry
* AWS Fargate
* Security Group
* Subnet
