Devops Cloud world is like planet Earth 🌍
Earth has Countries, States, Cities 🌐
Cloud has Regions, Availability zones, Data Centers ⛅

Earth has a Home for you, your own space 🏡
Cloud has VPC for you, your own space 📦

Each country has one default Flag 🇮🇳
Each Region has one default VPC 🗳

Home is partioned into small Rooms 🎛
VPC is partioned into small Subnets 💠

Each State is mapped to a Pincode 🔢
Each AZ is mapped to a Subnet ❇

If a Region has 6 AZ, it gona have 6 subnets, mapped to those 6 AZ's inside 1 default VPC ⏪
